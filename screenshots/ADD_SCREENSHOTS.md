# How to Add Screenshots

## Steps to Add Your Screenshots

1. **Save your screenshot images** to this `screenshots/` directory

2. **Name them exactly as shown below:**
   - `main-view.png` - Full application view
   - `event-list.png` - Event list sidebar
   - `ecg-plot-afib.png` - AFIB event plot
   - `ecg-plot-vtach.png` - VTACH event plot
   - `ecg-plot-brady.png` - BRADY event plot
   - `event-info.png` - Event information panel
   - `multiple-events.png` - Multiple event types view
   - `api-docs.png` - API documentation page

3. **After adding images, commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add screenshots/*.png
   git commit -m 'Add application screenshots'
   git push origin main
   ```

## Screenshot Requirements

- ✅ Event list showing 62 events
